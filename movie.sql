12.  delete from movies where title = 'Little Man Tate'  # Since there is no actors table, its deletion doesn't affect anything since it has no foreign keys anywhere.

13.  delete from directors where first_name = 'Ava'  # Would lose Relational integrity for any movie associated with the deleted director.  A cascading delete would be required where everything that has a foreign key constrainst attached would also be deleted.  In other words, 'A Wrinkle in Time' would also have to be deleted prior to the director's deletion.
